# The Kingsley Marmalade Recipe

As told to SCJK by CJCK in 2015

A batch makes 12 to 15 jam jars worth depending on size - filled to brim.

## Ingredients

### Fruit

A total of 1.5 kg fruit per batch.

Lemons (1 to 4 ratio of lemons to other fruit.)

- Seville oranges
- Grapefruit is required

### Sugar

- Jam sugar 3 kg per batch

### Other

- Ginger to taste if required - stem or in syrup.

## Method

1. If using dishwasher to sterilise jars put it on now.
    - As long as jars are clean sterilising is not strictly necessary.
    - Smell jars to make sure you're not using the stinky pickle ones.
    - Remove old marker pen from lids with meths and a paper towel before washing.

1. Put a stack of saucers or small plates in the freezer.

1. Prep chopping area
    - Cover chopping table with newspaper.
    - Put chopping board inside a tray to capture all juices.
    - Sharpen knives!

1. Put 3 kg of jam sugar in bags in oven to preheat - plate warming setting or less only! Any higher and the sugar will burn in the bags.

1. Weigh out the fruit.
    - Weigh ~25% of 1.5 kg (375 g) in lemons. It doesn't matter if slightly over or under.
    - Make the rest of the 1.5 kg up with other fruit - seville oranges, grapefruit, or a mixture.
    - Not limes!

1. Prep the fruit
    - De-label and de-stalk the fruit.
    - Quarter fruit and slice out pith with downwards 45% cut (SHARP KNIVES!) to expose pips.
    - Remove pips with a teaspoon handle - Place pips and pith in medium saucepan with a lid.
    - Slice fruit thinly. Slice each quarter length-ways almost all the way along. Leave a short section still joined at one end to help slicing across.
    - Add fruit to jam pan (or a large saucepan if you have no lid for the jam pan). Put both pans on hob.

1. Boil fruit.
    - Get 3 L of water from water butt!
    - Strain into kettle and boil.
    - Add 1 L to pith pan and 2 L to fruit pan.
    - Simmer covered for 2 h.
    - (When using Mum's aluminium pan I added a weight to the lid.)

1. Combining and adding sugar
    - Strain liquor from pith pan into main jam pan and discard pips etc.
    - Rinse out pith pan with a little more boiling water (not too much!) to capture all fruity goodness.
    - TURN HEAT OUT from under jam pan. You don't want to burn the undissolved sugar as you add it.
    - Tip in 3 kg of preheated sugar and stir until all sugar has dissolved.

1. Setting
    - Whack the heat up to max to get a rolling boil.
    - After about 10 mins at boil start testing samples on cold plates. It helps to put sample outside to help cool them down.
    - Keep going till set - may take 30 mins or so.
    - When set is right - jar up.

1. Jars
    - Transfer to jars.
    - Easier using a small milk jug as a scoop.
    - Seal lids tight when still hot. Using an old gents leather glove to hold the hot jars makes this easier.
    - Label lids using permanent marker; it saves buggering about with sticky labels on hot jars and makes washing up easier when the jar is empty.
