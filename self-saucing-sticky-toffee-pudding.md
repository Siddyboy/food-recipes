# Carbonara

Serves 6

## Ingredients

### Pasta

- Spagetti 500 g

### Sauce

- Guanciale or pancetta 10 slices
- Unsalted butter knob
- Black peppercorns 1 tspn
- Egg yolks 5
- Eggs 1
- Pecorino romano (young)

## Method

1. Chop about the guanciale or pancetta.

2. Begin to cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling (salted) water.

3. In a frying pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.

4. Put the black peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.

5. Beat the egg yolks and the egg in a warm bowl with 3 tablespoons of grated cheese.

6. One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.

7. Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.

8. Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture. The heat of the spaghetti will cook the eggs without scrambling them. Add more black pepper, if you like.

## Notes

From Giorgio Locatelli

The true cured pork to use for carbonara is guanciale, which comes from the cheek, and has less fat than pancetta. Don't cut it too finely or regularly, as you want a nice chunk to bite into every now and then amid the silkiness of the egg.

Some people add the eggs and cheese to the pan, but it is easy to underestimate the heat of the pan, and the danger is always that the eggs will scramble. So I prefer to mix the eggs and cheese in a warm bowl and then tip in the hot spaghetti, which will cook the eggs but keep their silkiness.

SCJK says - easy on the salt, there's loads in the bacon.
