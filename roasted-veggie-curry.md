# Roasted Veggie Curry

with spiced spinach-stuffed naan

1 hr 10 mins, not too tricky, serves 8

## About the recipe

Roasting the veg before immersing them in a ridiculously tasty sauce really intensifies their natural flavour, giving you even more bang for your buck.
I’ve kept things fairly gentle on the spice front so that all my kids will give it a go, but feel free to add extra heat, if you like.
I’m also giving you a cheat’s naan, which all my kids fight over.

## Ingredients
- Madras currey paste - 1 heaped teaspoon
- Olive oil
- Red wine vinegar
- Parsnip 1
- Carrots 2
- Butternut squash one half (600g)
- Courgette 1
- Frozen cauliflower 200 g
- Piece of ginger 4 cm
- Garlic 2 cloves
- Mango chutney 2 tablespoons
- Plum tomatoes 400 g
- Light coconut milk 400 g
- Frozen peas 100 g

### Stuffed Naan
- Unsalted butter 1 small knob
- Cloves 6
- Cinnamon stick half
- Leek 1 small
- Frozen spinach 300 g
- Self-raising flour 600 g plus extra for dusting
- Feta cheese 100 g

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC.
2. In a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar.
3. Wash the parsnip, carrots, and butternut squash (we’re leaving the skins on).  Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray as you go.
4. Repeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots.  Deseed the squash and chop to a similar size.  Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower and mix until well coated.
5. Roast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden, gnarly and cooked through.
6. Meanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat.  Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly.
7. As soon as it starts to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon.  As soon as they start to bubble, add the coconut milk.  Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat.
8. To make the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick.
9. Trim the leek and quarter lengthways, wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach.  Stir regularly, until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool.
10. Pour the flour into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil.  Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix.
11. At this point, use your clean floured hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed.  You want it to be pliable so don’t add too much flour, but it shouldn’t be sticking to your work surface.
12. Now, oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle.  Crumble the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle of the dough, leaving a 5 cm border at the edge.
13. Fold in the dough over the filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into it.
14. Cook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle.
15. A few minutes before you’re ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the sauce is a good consistency.
16. Slice up your naan and serve up with your curry at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you like.

2. Leftover curry paste? Mix a little with natural yoghurt for a speedy dip to eat with poppadoms. Or add some to a tray of roasted veg for beautiful flavour.
