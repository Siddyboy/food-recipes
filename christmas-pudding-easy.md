# Easy Christmas Pudding

Recipe for Christmas Pudding used for Stir-Up Sunday 2023.

Preparation time: 2 hrs and 45 mins - 3 hrs, including steaming.

Serves: 8 - 10 (see notes)

## Ingredients

- Sultanas 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Raisins 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Self-raising flour 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Butter finely grated 1 cup or 115 g (575 g)
- Fresh breadcrumbs 1 cup (whole large brown loaf)
- Light muscovado sugar 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Mixed nuts 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Ground cinnamon 1 tsp (5 tsp)
- Ground mixed spice 1 tsp (5 tsp)
- Milk 1 cup (1.25 L)
- Egg beaten 1 large (5 large)
- Butter for greasing

### For the butterscotch sauce

- Butter 85 g
- Light muscovado sugar 100 g
- Double cream 200 ml
- Vanilla extract 1 tsp

## Method

1. For the pudding, empty the first six items and the nuts, if using, into a mixing bowl with the spices, then stir in the milk and egg.  Once well combined, tip into a buttered 1.5 L pudding bowl.
2. Cover with a double layer of buttered foil, making a pleat in the centre to allow the pudding to rise.  Tie the foil securely with string, then place in a steamer or large pan containing enough gently simmering water to come halfway up the sides of the bowl.  Steam, covered with a lid, for 2.5 hours.  Check the water level during cooking, topping up if necessary.  If you are preparing this pudding ahead, remove the foil, let it cool slightly, then wrap in cling film and then fresh foil.  If you are serving it immediately unwrap and invert onto a deep plate.
3. For the sauce, put everything in a pan and bring slowly to the boil, stirring.  Allow to bubble away for 2-3 minutes, still stirring, until the sugar has dissolved and the sauce is pale caramel colour and slightly thickened.  Pout the sauce over the pudding and decorate with the whole mixed nuts.
