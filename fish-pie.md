# Fantastic Fish Pie

The whole fish pie thing is one of the most homely, comforting and moreish dinners I can think of.
This is a cracking recipe which does it for me.

1 hr plus cooling.
Not Too Tricky.
Serves 6.

## Ingredients

- Potatoes 5 large
- Free-range eggs 2 large
- Baby spinach 2 large handfuls
- Oonion 1
- Carrot 1
- Olive oil
- Double cream 250 ml
- Mature Cheddar or Parmesan cheese
- Lemon 1
- English mustard 1 heaped teaspoon
- Fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 large handful
- Haddock or cod fillet, skin off, pin-boned, from sustainable sources 450 g
- Nutmeg, for grating 1 whole (optional)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 230 C.
1. Peel and dice the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks, then put into boiling salted water and bring back to the boil for 2 minutes.
1. Carefully add the eggs to the pan and cook for a further 8 minutes, or until hard-boiled, by which time the potatoes should also be cooked.
1. At the same time, steam the spinach in a colander above the pan. This will only take a minute. When the spinach is done, remove from the colander and gently squeeze out any excess moisture.
1. Drain the potatoes in the colander. Remove the eggs, cool under cold water, then peel and quarter them. Place to one side.
1. Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel, halve and finely chop the carrot.
1. In a separate pan, slowly fry the onion and carrot in a little oil for about 5 minutes, then add the double cream and bring just to the boil.
1. Remove from the heat and finely grate in 2 good handfuls of cheese, then squeeze in the lemon juice and stir through the mustard.
1. Pick and finely chop the parsley and stir into the cream mixture.
1. Slice the fish into strips then place in an earthenware dish with the spinach and eggs and mix together, pouring over the creamy vegetable sauce.
1. The cooked potatoes should be drained and mashed - add a bit of oil, sea salt, black pepper and a touch of nutmeg (if using).  Spread on top of the fish.  Don't bother piping it to make it look pretty - it's a homely hearty thing.
1. Place in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden.
1. Serve with some nice peas or greens, not forgetting your baked beans and tomato ketchup.  Tacky but tasty, and that's what I like.
