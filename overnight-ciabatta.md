# Overnight Refrigerator Ciabatta

Four ingredient, no-knead.

Makes 4 small to medium size loaves.

## Ingredients

- Lukewarm water 400 ml
- Salt 9 g
- Dried yeast 7 g (one sachet)
- Strong flour 450 g

## Preparing the Dough

1. In a large bowl, mix together the lukewarm water, salt and yeast.
Don’t worry about mixing the salt and yeast together like this - it’s a myth that this will kill the yeast.
2. Add the flour, and mix well using a fork to form a very wet, loose shaggy dough.
Cover the bowl, and leave dough for 30 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.
3. We are going to perform four rounds of "stretches and folds".
Take one side of the dough, stretch and fold bringing the dough to the opposite side of the bowl.
Rotate the bowl one quarter and repeat another 3 times.
4. Cover the bowl and leave for 30 minutes.
5. Repeat the stretch and fold process another 3 times, leaving 30 minutes in between each round.
6. After your last series of stretch and folds, cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in the fridge over night.
The cold overnight fermentation really helps to develop delicious flavors in the ciabatta.
7. The next day, take the ciabatta out of the fridge.
Aside from developing great flavors overnight, the dough is much easier to work with cold compared to when it’s at room temperature.
8. Generously dust a region of your counter top with flour.
It should be a big enough region for you to tip the dough out onto the floured surface.
The dough is very wet, so I recommend using a fine mesh strainer to ensure there are no gaps in the flour on the surface.
If there are gaps, the dough will stick the counter top, and you won’t be able to shape it.
9. You will be using two clean dish towels for the final proofing stage of the bread.
Using a fine mesh strainer, as you did for the countertop, dust two patches of the dish flour on one end of each towel.
That’s four patches in total—one for each small loaf of ciabatta.
You will be placing the shaped loaves on the patches of flour for final proofing.
This will allow you flip the clean half of the towels over onto the loaves to cover them.
10. Transfer the dough to the floured work surface by turning the bowl upside down.
Let gravity do the work of letting the dough fall out of the bowl.
Be patient — give the bowl a rub and a tap, and the dough will come loose.
11. Using wet hands, and working quickly and with a light touch, tidy up the dough so it forms a square.
Then quickly fold it in half so the dough forms a rectangle.
(Doing this will create more tension in the dough, which will give the ciabatta more oven spring when it goes in the oven.)
Tuck in all the edges so the dough forms a neat rectangle.
Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into four small, roughly equally sized loaves.
12. Using you fingers in a block like paddles, quickly pick up a portion of dough from the counter top with your fingers underneath the dough and transfer it to a prepared patch of flour on one of the dish towels.
Gently, shape it roughly into a rectangular shape.
Repeat this for the other portions of dough.
Then, gently flip the clean halves of the towels over to cover the ciabatta.
Allow the loaves to proof for a final 20 minutes.
13. While the dough is proofing for its final stage, preheat your oven with a large pizza stone in it to 230°C.
If your oven has a convection fan fan, make sure the fan is on.
Using a pizza stone (or pizza steel) is really the best way to bake ciabatta.
If you don’t have a pizza stone, you can use a large baking tray instead.
14. Prepare two pieces piece of parchment paper big enough to easily fit two of the small loaves.
Right now, you have your portions of dough resting on the dish towels.
The bottom sides of the dough will become the top sides of the ciabatta.
So you need to flip them over before transferring to the parchment paper as gently as possible to avoid loosing any air.
I like to use a large bench scraper to help with this.
15. You will be baking the 4 loaves in two batches.
Slide one piece of the parchment paper with two loaves onto the preheated pizza stone.
Throw a handful of ice cubes into the bottom of the oven, and close the oven door.
This will create a steam environment that will allow the ciabatta loaves to rise quickly before the crust sets.
Bake for around 15 to 20 minutes.
The ciabatta is ready when it’s a deep golden brown color—use this visual sign to tell when the bread is ready.
