About the recipe

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with using a packet stuffing, but I promise you won’t regret making your own. This combo is such a good one – the sweetness of the apricots pairs beautifully with the sausage meat.

Ingredients
2 onions

1 bunch of fresh sage (30g)

50g unsalted butter

olive oil

2 clementines

1 whole nutmeg

optional: 100g higher-welfare turkey livers

100g dried apricots

100ml Vin Santo

200g stale bread

400g higher-welfare sausage meat or pork mince

Top Tip
GET AHEAD: You can make this in advance up to the stage where it’s ready to bake, then cover and leave in the fridge overnight.

Method
Peel and roughly chop the onions, wash the sage leaves in warm water.
Place a large frying pan on a medium-high heat with the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil. Tear in most of the sage leaves, then add the onions, the clementine zest, a good grating of nutmeg and a pinch of black pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and fry for 5 to 10 minutes, until the onions start to soften.
Meanwhile, trim the livers, if using, remove any sinews and roughly chop with the apricots, then stir into the pan. Once the time’s up on the onions, pour in the Vin Santo, turn up the heat to medium-high and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the alcohol has cooked away. Leave to cool completely.
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Whiz the stale bread to crumbs in a food processor then stir into the pan along with the sausage meat.
Use your hands to squash and squidge everything until well combined. Put half of the stuffing mixture (around 500g) aside to stuff the neck and legs of your turkey, then pack the rest into an oiled baking dish (15cm x 20cm). Flatten the stuffing down and use your hands to almost tuck the edges into the dish to create a mound in the middle.
Scatter over the reserved sage leaves and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil then bake for 50 minutes, or until cooked through, golden and bubbling.# Carbonara

Serves 6

## Ingredients

### Pasta

- Spagetti 500 g

### Sauce

- Guanciale or pancetta 10 slices
- Unsalted butter knob
- Black peppercorns 1 tspn
- Egg yolks 5
- Eggs 1
- Pecorino romano (young)

## Method

1. Chop about the guanciale or pancetta.

2. Begin to cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling (salted) water.

3. In a frying pan, heat the butter, then put in the guanciale or pancetta and fry until golden and crispy. Take off the heat, and lift out to a warm plate, so that it stays crunchy.

4. Put the black peppercorns into the pan and crush with a meat hammer or the end of a rolling pin, then add a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking water from the pasta and stir it around to take up all the bits of guanciale or pancetta which may have stuck to the bottom of the pan.

5. Beat the egg yolks and the egg in a warm bowl with 3 tablespoons of grated cheese.

6. One minute before the spaghetti is ready, start to mix in a ladleful of the cooking water at a time until the eggs and cheese become creamy.

7. Drain the pasta (but reserve the cooking water) and toss it in the pan of pepper, together with the reserved guanciale or pancetta.

8. Add a little more cooking water if the pasta seems too dry, then transfer it to the bowl of eggs and cheese and toss well, until coated in the silky mixture. The heat of the spaghetti will cook the eggs without scrambling them. Add more black pepper, if you like.

## Notes

From Giorgio Locatelli

The true cured pork to use for carbonara is guanciale, which comes from the cheek, and has less fat than pancetta. Don't cut it too finely or regularly, as you want a nice chunk to bite into every now and then amid the silkiness of the egg.
