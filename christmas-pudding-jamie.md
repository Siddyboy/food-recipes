## Ingredients
- Unsalted butter, for greasing
- Medjool dates 150 g (900 g)
- Dried apricots 150 g (900 g)
- Pecan nuts 150 g (900 g)
- Crystallized ginger 75 g (450 g)
- Fresh rosemary 1 small sprig (6 sprigs?)
- Dried cranberries 150 g (900 g)
- Raisins 150 g (900 g)
- Suet 150 g (900 g)
- Plain flour 150 g (900 g)
- Fresh breadcrumbs 75 g (450 g)
- Semi-skimmed milk 200 ml (1.2 L)
- Free-range egg 1 large (6 large)
- Clementine 1 (6)
- Golden syrup
- Barrel-aged Bourbon

## Method

1. Grease a 1.5 litre pudding bowl with butter.
2. Destone your dates, then, by hand or in a food processor, finely chop the flesh with the apricots, pecans, ginger and rosemary leaves.
3. Place it all in a mixing bowl with the cranberries, raisins, suet, flour, breadcrumbs and milk.
4. Crack in the egg, finely grate in the clementine zest, squeeze in the juice and mix it all together really well.
5. Tip the mixture into the greased bowl and cover with a single layer of greaseproof paper and a double layer of tin foil.
6. Tie a piece of string around the bowl to secure them in place and make it watertight, then sit it in a large, deep saucepan and pour in enough water (into the saucepan, not the pudding!) to come halfway up the sides of the bowl.
8. Bring the water to the boil, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and reduce to a simmer for 4 hours. Check the water regularly, and keep topping it up with boiling water, if needed.
9. When the time’s up, lift out the bowl, remove the foil and paper, then carefully turn the pudding out on to a plate ready to serve, or leave to cool and reheat just before you need it.
10. You can either drizzle it with golden syrup and a swig of Bourbon – gorgeous – or be a bit more flamboyant and gently heat a good few swigs of Bourbon just to warm it, then strike a match to the pan (stand back!), let it flame, and carefully pour it over your pudding.
11. Present it to your guests and sing some Christmassy songs, then when the flame subsides drizzle with golden syrup. Serve with cream, custard or even ice cream.

## Notes

1. Recipe From Jamie Oliver's Christmas Cookbook.  He says: "This is based on my dear Nan’s beautiful pudding recipe, which gives you a much lighter result than a traditional Christmas pud. It has more dynamic flavours, and is super-easy to make – this is exactly the way I like it best. Enjoy!"
2. Taken part in Stir-Up Sunday? Then make sure you carefully store your beautiful Christmas pudding, so you don't run the risk of it going mouldy. Once you've steamed and totally cooled it, replace the greaseproof paper and tin foil with a fresh set and seal it super tightly, so it's airtight. Then store it in a cool, dry place until you're ready to reheat it on Christmas Day. NOTE: A hot steamy kitchen is not ideal!
