### For the crepe

- Plain flour 60 g
- Egg 1
- Milk 140 ml

## Method

1. Dice mushrooms and cook in a pan at a medium heat with a pinch of sea salt flakes and a teaspoon of oil.
2. Boil your parsnips for approx. 5 minutes, before mashing and mixing with the mushrooms.
3. Next, add your crushed hazelnuts, tarragon, panko, taleggio cheese, egg and blitz all together in a food processor.
4. Blanch the Savoy cabbage leaves for 30 seconds, then refresh the leaves in iced water.
5. To make the crÃªpe, whisk together the milk, flour & egg and season with salt & pepper.
6. Cook the mix in a large non-stick pan over a medium heat, until golden on both sides.
7. Spread your crepe out flat and layer the Savoy leaves on top of the crepe.
8. Then, spoon the wellington mix on top, and roll the crepe and cabbage around so it covers the whole mix.
9. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 20 mins.
10. Egg wash the edges and inside of your pastry sheet and wrap around your wellington mix, folding the edges like a parcel.  Chill again for another 20 minutes to hold its shape.
11. Finally, egg wash and score the top of the pastry, and bake the whole wellington at 220 degrees for 30-35 minutes, until pastry is golden brown.
12. Rest for 15 minutes, carve and enjoy!
