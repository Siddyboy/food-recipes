# Beef Wellington

Can be made the night before and chilled.

## Ingredients

- A good beef fillet of around 1 kg
- Olive oil 3 tbsp
- English mustard
- Chestnut mushrooms 700 g
- Garlic 1 clove
- Chestnuts 6
- Fresh thyme 1 large spring
- Parma ham 12 slices
- Puff pastry ready rolled 500 g
- Egg yolks beaten 2

## Method

1. Season beef with salt and pepper.
2. Quickly sear in hot pan with olive oil.
3. Remove and sit on a plate. Spread with English mustard while still hot.
4. Chop chestnut mushrooms, garlic, chestnuts and salt and pepper as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs.  You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.
5. Cook mixture in a large dry pan until moisture is removed, (about 10 minutes), adding fresh thyme.
6. Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool on a baking tray and discard the thyme.
8. Cling film over a large chopping board.
9. Lay 12 slices parma ham on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row. Twist of pepper, no salt.
10. Spread the duxelles over the ham half an inch from the ends, then sit the fillet on it.
11. Use the cling film’s edges to draw the ham around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.
12. Chill the fillet for 15 min to firm up while you prep the pastry.
13. Fresh cling film, pastry on top.
14. Unravel the fillet from its cling film and sit it in the centre of the pastry.
15. Roll up again in cling film tucking in the ends of the pastry like a parcel.
16. Chill for 5 minutes or overnight.
17. Heat the oven to 200 C
18. Glaze all over with egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.
19. Sprinkle with salt.
21. Cook for 35 mins.
22. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices.
