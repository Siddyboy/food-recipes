# Pizza dough

Preparation time over 2 hours

Cooking time 10 to 30 mins

Makes 6 x 20 cm pizza bases

This recipe uses '00' flour to give the base a lighter, crisper texture.
But if you have bread flour, it will still produce a great homemade pizza.

## Ingredients

- '00' flour (or strong white flour) 650 g
- dried easy-blend yeast 7 g
- salt 2 tsp
- Olive oil 25 ml
- Warm milk 50 ml
- Warm water 325 ml

## Method

1. Mix the flour, yeast and salt together in a large bowl and stir in the olive oil and milk.

1. Gradually add the water, mixing well to form a soft dough.

1. Turn the dough out on to a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic.

1. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp teatowel and leave to rise for about 1Â½ hours, until doubled in size.

1. When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth, roll into a ball and set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour until risen again.

1. Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out on a lightly floured work surface until 20 cm in diameter.

## Notes

1. You can freeze the dough after step 5. Divide into 6 balls and wrap each one in cling film. Defrost overnight in the fridge before proceeding with the recipe.
