## Notes

- Contains *no* nuts.
- Extra sultanas in mix of dried fruits make it jucier.
- Small jars are handier for retrieving the mincemeat.
- I have kept it for a year and it was fine, stored in very clean (dishwashed) dry jars in a dark cool cupboard, but it does taste better when younger - more individual flavours.

- Kept frozen in plastic box for over a year and seems to be OK.
