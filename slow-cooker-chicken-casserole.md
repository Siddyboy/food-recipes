# Slow-cooker chicken casserole

Serves 6

## Ingredients

- Butter knob
- Olive oil 1 tbsp
- Onions (finely chopped) 2
- Flour 3 tbsp
- Chicken THIGHS*, boneless and skinless 1.2 kg
- Garlic 2 cloves crushed
- Baby new potatoes, halved, 800 g
- Celery diced 4 sticks
- Carrots diced 4
- Mushrooms quartered 500 g
- Dried prcini mushrooms 30 g
- Chicken stock (Kallo) 1 L
- Dijon mustard 4 tsp
- Bay leaves 4

## Method

1. See prep notes below for some time saving advice!
  
3. If you need to preheat your slow cooker then turn it on now.

4. Heat (half) the butter and oil in a large pan and cook the onions and garlic on a low heat for at least 10 minutes until starting to caramelise.

5. Meanwhile put the flour and seasoning in a large bowl and toss the chicken to coat.
  
7. Tip the onions into the slow cooker and turn up the heat under the pan.

9. Fry the chicken (in two batches) until they start to brown.  Tip into the slow cooker.

11. Add to the slow cooker the potatoes, celery, carrots, mushrooms, porcini mushrooms with the soaking liquid, the stock, mustard and bay leaves.

12. Cook on low for 7 hours or high for 4 hours.

## Notes

1. From BBC Good Food recipe but doubled quantities.  This amount fits nicely in the slow cooker, just.
2. To simplify.  While the onions are sweating, add the stock, dried porcini, and boiling water to the slow cooker first.
3. Do not use chicken breasts - they will be mega-dry.  Use thighs only.
