# Slow Cooker Pork Casserole

Serves 4, prep 15 mins, cook 6-8 hrs.

Cosy up on cold nights with our comforting slow cooker pork casserole.
Chopped apples would make a great addition; add them in the final hour of cooking.

## Ingredients

- Vegetable oil 1 tbsp
- Pork shoulder steaks 4, about 750g, cut into large chunks
- Onion 1, chopped
- Leek 1, chopped
- Carrot 1, chopped
- Woody herbs 1 bundle (bouquet garni); 2 bay leaves, 3 sage leaves and 4 thyme sprigs, plus a few thyme leaves to serve
- Chicken stock 1 cube
- Dijon mustard 2 tsp
- Cider vinegar 1 tbsp
- Cornflour 2 tsp
- Honey 1 tbsp

## Method

1.  Heat your slow cooker.
2.  Drizzle the oil in a wide frying pan over a high heat.
3.  Season the pork, then add to the hot pan.
4.  Avoid overcrowding the meat; you may want to do this in batches.
5.  Cook until deep brown all over, then transfer to the slow cooker.
6.  Add the onion and leeks to the frying pan and cook for a few mins, until they soften.
7.  Add a splash of water and scrape any tasty bits from the bottom, then tip everything into the slow cooker.
8.  Add the carrot, herbs, stock cube, mustard and vinegar, season, then add enough water to just cover the ingredients.
9.  Stir, then set your slow cooker on low for 6-8 hrs, or high for 5-6 hrs.
10. Wait.
11. In a saucepan, mix the cornflour and honey with 1-2 tsp of liquid from the slow cooker, until you have a smooth paste.
12. Add 100 ml more liquid, bring to a simmer until thickened, then stir back into the casserole.
13. Serve with mash or dumplings, scattered with thyme leaves.
