4. Cover the bowl preferably with a lid or a cloth bowl cover.
5. Stick the bowl in the fridge immediately; leave it there to rise for 12 to 18 hours (or for as long as three days).
6. Remove from fridge, and remove the cover.
7. Deflate the dough and transfer to a prepared pan and don't touch it.
8. Put it in the top oven with just the light on.
9. After two to four hours it’s time to dimple it!
10. You can simply use olive oil and sea salt.
11. If you are using rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough.
12. Then pour two tablespoons of olive oil over the dough, and using your fingers, press straight down to create deep dimples.
13. Sprinkle with sea salt.
14. Transfer to oven immediately and bake at 220 C for 25 minutes or until golden all around.
15. Remove focaccia from pans and place on cooling racks.

## Notes

1.  It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a lid.
If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover.
If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer.
2.  A 230 by 330 pan is good.
3.  10 g of salt was very salty!  Try 5 g next time.  5 g is good.  Yeah but 10 g in the dough and go easy on the sprinkles is better.
4.  Best non-stick is to line the pan with wet, scrumpled baking paper.
