## Notes

1.  It is important the dough really be slicked with olive oil especially if you are using a cloth bowl cover or tea towel as opposed to plastic wrap or a lid.
If you are using a tea towel, consider securing it with a rubber band to make a more airtight cover.
If you do not slick the dough with enough oil, you risk the dough drying out and forming a crust over the top layer.
2.  A 230 by 330 pan is good.
3.  10 g of salt was very salty!  Try 5 g next time.  5 g is good.
4.  Try buttering the pan next time.  Oiling didn't stop the side sticking.
